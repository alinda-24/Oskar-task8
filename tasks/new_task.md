## 📖 Exercises Outline

### Exercise 1: Understanding File Formats and Parsing 🚦

**Objective**: Establish a foundational understanding of file parsing relevant to game development.

**Instructions**:
- Research and summarize different file formats commonly used in game development (e.g., JSON, XML, CSV).
- Explain how data parsing is used to instantiate objects in a game context.
- **Deliverable**: A short report (300-500 words) explaining chosen file formats and parsing techniques.

### Exercise 2: Designing Classes for a Sci-Fi Game 🤖

**Objective**: Plan the class structure for your game.

**Instructions**:
- Identify key classes needed for the "Star Voyager" game, such as `Room`, `Item`, `Player`, `Spaceship`.
- Define class responsibilities, attributes, and methods.
- Illustrate a UML diagram for the game’s class architecture.
- **Deliverable**: A UML diagram and explanatory notes on class design.

### Exercise 3: File I/O in Java for Game Initialization 📂

**Objective**: Implement file reading to initialize game objects.

**Instructions**:
- Write a method, `loadGameComponents(String filename)`, to read room and item data from a file and instantiate corresponding objects.
- Ensure the process handles exceptions gracefully and maintains data integrity.
- **Code Snippet**:
  ```java
  private void loadGameComponents(String filename) throws IOException {
      // Example logic for reading and instantiating objects
      // Ensure data is correctly parsed and integrated into game state
  }
  ```
- **Deliverable**: Functional code that successfully reads from a provided data file and initializes game objects.

### Exercise 4: Implementing Interactive Environment ⚙️

**Objective**: Integrate class designs into an interactive game environment.

**Instructions**:
- Utilize classes from Exercise 2 to set up an interactive environment where the player can move between rooms and interact with items.
- Implement a basic game loop for player actions (e.g., move, pick up item).
- **Deliverable**: A rudimentary interactive environment demonstrating player navigation and interaction.

### Exercise 5: Expanding the Game World 🌌

**Objective**: Scale up your game with additional complexity and functionality.

**Step-by-Step Instructions**:
1. Extend the game world to include at least 8 unique room types.
2. Implement complex item interactions, such as combining items to repair ship components.
3. Add a "win condition" where the player successfully repairs the spacecraft:
   - Create a method to check if repair objectives are met.
   - Display a victory message once the player completes all objectives.

**Deliverable**: A complete game environment with detailed item interactions and a winning condition.

### Exercise 6: Testing, Feedback, and Iteration 🔄

**Objective**: Refine your game through testing and feedback.

**Instructions**:
- Conduct user testing with peers and document feedback.
- Iterate on the design based on the feedback, focusing on improving user experience and game mechanics.
- Provide a summary of the changes made and their impact on gameplay.
- **Deliverable**: A refined game version along with a report (200-300 words) summarizing user feedback and subsequent changes.
